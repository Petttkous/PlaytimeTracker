# Playtime Tracker
A simple server side mode for tracking playtime, without tracking AFK time.

There are 2 trackers, one for alltime, and one for temporary tracking, that can be used as a monthly or weekly tracker. 

Also adds a few advancements for getting specified amounts of playtime (10, 25, 50, 100 hours)

When a player goes afk for over five minutes, playtime tracking halts for that player, and their name goes gray in the 
tab list. Using strict afk detection, players can afk at farms that move them around and still be recognized as afk.

All commands are accessed from the `/playtime` command, which it has an extensive help message to explain how to use the
every command.
